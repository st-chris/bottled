Work in progress:

- Adding order history / details
- Advanced stripe payments

A simple webshop for Brewdog's beers (info from [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/)), with the ability to register as a user. Adding the beers to a cart/crate and paying through Stripe.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), see their website for more info.

## Getting started

This project uses concurrently to combine an express backend and react frontend server.
In the main folder you'll have to create a .env file with the following information:
MONGO_URI=**INSERT MONGODB INFO**
JWT_SECRET=**INSERT SECRET FOR JSONWEBTOKEN**
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=**INSERT STRIPE SECRET KEY**

To seed the beers into your db, uncomment the seedproducts lines in server.js. After this, comment out these lines again to avoid this from happening everytime you start the server.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode, both front/backend.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
